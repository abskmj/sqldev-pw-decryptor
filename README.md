# SQL Developer Password Decryptor
Oracle SQL Developer allows a user to associate passwords with connections so that the user doesn't have to enter the password each time he opens a connection. Of course, these passwords need to be stored somewhere. SQL developer stores them in an encrypted form, but it is possible to decrypt them.
